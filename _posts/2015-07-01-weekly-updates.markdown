# Center for Child and Law

_30th December 2016, at CCL, NLS Bangalore at around 11 AM._

We introduced our project to Mr. Niranjan. The discussion went as follows:

1. Mr. Niranjan said that we should do a case study of the school we have chosen for the field project.
1. The case study will involve creation of a checklist of things that should be present in the School Development Monitoring Committee (SDMC) as per the Right to Education Act. We will then analyze the gap between law and implementation.
1. For understanding this gap, we will interview and have a discussion with various SDMC members.
1. We propose that we should create a model SDMC in the school we have selected. Mr. Niranjan mentioned that to achieve this, we should create a strong link between the Panchayat and the SDMC.
1. We will also be requiring a permission letter from the BO of the village. This will require a letter from APU.
1. The tentative next step will be one awareness program for the school.
1. We asked Mr. Niranjan for examples of schools with a well-functioning SDMC. He invited us to visit the SDMCs at Ranmagar Schools.
1. We were also informed about the CCL office in Bidadi which is engaged in the SDMC project. We plan to visit this office after our initial study.
1. To gather information on SDMC and related laws, we were informed by Mr. Niranjan to look at the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2009.
1. Nearing the end of our conversation, we generally discussed the state of SDMCs and their importance in improving public education.

# Meeting with an SDMC member

## (Mother of one of the kids at the school)

_1st Feb 2017_

We had a meeting with the mother of Laxmi (a student in the school we were working at). The mother is an SDMC member, however, surprisingly, she wasn't even aware thta she was one.

She was hesitant to meet with us because she thought that she is not the right person for us to meet because she was an illiterate female. We faced a few navigation issues because she was unable to guide us to her house with ease. Eventually, we were able to visit her at her house and have a peaceful discussion.

Their house was a small room, which was lovingly, neatly kept, despite  it being used as a bedroom, kitchen and puja room. Once she met us, she seemed relaxed, willing to talk, and opened up quite a bit. She appeared to be warm and loving, she even asked us to stay back and invited us to have dinner with her and her family.

She said she did not know that she was a SDMC member, but she is more than willing to go to the meeting if it benefits her kid. She wants Laxmi to become a doctor. She said that she is worried that her child has to sit on roads to have her food and that she doesn’t get the milk which she is supposed to get under the Mid-day Meals Scheme.
