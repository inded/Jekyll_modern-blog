title:  "Meeting with an SDMC member"
subtitle: "Mother of one of the kids at the school"
---
We had a meeting with the mother of Laxmi (a student in the school we were working at). The mother is an SDMC member, however, surprisingly, she wasn't even aware thta she was one.

She was hesitant to meet with us because she thought that she is not the right person for us to meet because she was an illiterate female. We faced a few navigation issues because she was unable to guide us to her house with ease. Eventually, we were able to visit her at her house and have a peaceful discussion.

Their house was a small room, which was lovingly, neatly kept, despite  it being used as a bedroom, kitchen and puja room. Once she met us, she seemed relaxed, willing to talk, and opened up quite a bit. She appeared to be warm and loving, she even asked us to stay back and invited us to have dinner with her and her family.

She said she did not know that she was a SDMC member, but she is more than willing to go to the meeting if it benefits her kid. She wants Laxmi to become a doctor. She said that she is worried that her child has to sit on roads to have her food and that she doesnâ€™t get the milk which she is supposed to get under the Mid-day Meals Scheme.
