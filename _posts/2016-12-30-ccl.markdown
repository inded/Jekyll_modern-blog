We introduced our project to Mr. Niranjan. The discussion went as follows:

1. Mr. Niranjan said that we should do a case study of the school we have chosen for the field project.
1. The case study will involve creation of a checklist of things that should be present in the School Development Monitoring Committee (SDMC) as per the Right to Education Act. We will then analyze the gap between law and implementation.
1. For understanding this gap, we will interview and have a discussion with various SDMC members.
1. We propose that we should create a model SDMC in the school we have selected. Mr. Niranjan mentioned that to achieve this, we should create a strong link between the Panchayat and the SDMC.
1. We will also be requiring a permission letter from the BO of the village. This will require a letter from APU.
1. The tentative next step will be one awareness program for the school.
1. We asked Mr. Niranjan for examples of schools with a well-functioning SDMC. He invited us to visit the SDMCs at Ranmagar Schools.
1. We were also informed about the CCL office in Bidadi which is engaged in the SDMC project. We plan to visit this office after our initial study.
1. To gather information on SDMC and related laws, we were informed by Mr. Niranjan to look at the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2009.
1. Nearing the end of our conversation, we generally discussed the state of SDMCs and their importance in improving public education.
