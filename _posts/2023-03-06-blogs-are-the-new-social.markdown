## So, whats all this about?
Well, i have entered the tech scene and see so many blogs that i hit on a daily basis with those hidden nuggets of knowledge. 

## So why a blog
As i go about my day, I have a lot of these momemnts i find, those where i find something that i think others may fnd interesting, get them out of a bind.
Theres time when a good rant is all i need, so here we are.
Then i think otheres might be interested in anothers journey in tech, self concerns etc

## Who am I.
Entered the tech scene!!!. Oh i hear, another halfwit thinking they can jump on the tech bandwaggon.
Well its not quite like that, for many years id had an interest in tech. Lots of playing over the yearshacking websites, playing and hacking games, fixing stuff (breaking stuff), building stuff.
I've played with windows and linux plus anything that I could get into. Ive worked in the manufacturing scene for a long time and linked alot of inopperable schemes together and dropped all the way back to using win3.1 for printing, macros in MSoffice,  UNIX, C#, lots of wierd and wonderful tech bits.
So, decided to go to uni and take a BSc in CompSci and Cyber Sec.

Now, really in the tech scene now. I work for a real tech company.

Thats it. I know stuff that im trying to fit into my new existance, know new stuff that im seeing if it is useful and the stuff im learning is like the horizon.
Its daunting, exciting and so often i wonder, can i do this... Obviously yeah and id like to share all this with you :D
