We started our initial field visit in the Government school, Konappana Agrahara. It has a functional and active School Development and Monitoring Committee (SDMC). We also found the school in Basapura Village to have a dysfunctional and inactive SDMC.

As a result, we will be focusing on a comparitive study between the schools within Basapura Village and Konappana Agrahara village. We plan to take up the intervention in the SDMC of the school in Basapura.

### Rationale of the Project

There are various studies on community participation in school management which are clearly establishing a direct correlation between the active participation of the community and the well-functioning of school. But unfortunately, in many places &emdash; especially in many villages like Basapura &emdash; the SDMC is almost dysfunctional. Therefore, this project could be seen as an attempt to strengthen SDMC, thereby strengthening the memebers involvement in school management, which in turn, will have a long-term positive impact on the quality of education in the government school located in Basapura.
