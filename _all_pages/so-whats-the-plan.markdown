* Getting necessary permissions from concerned BEO, other offices and other educational officials to do an initial fieldwork at the selected SDMC.
* Performing a comparative field study at both the locations. This will mainly focus on the various enabling factors that make the SDMC at Konappana Agrahara active and functional, and the and disabling factors that makes Basapura inactive. This will also allow us to identify the problems and challenges SDMC is facing.
* Devising, based on this field study, the necessary intervention strategy in accordance with the context and needs of the location.
* Conducting eight awareness generation workshop about the SDMC.
* Meeting all the members of SDMC as a group in their regular meetings. If this is not possible, we will reach out to individual members in Basapura and convince them about the importance of the SDMC and our project; and we will request their cooperation in conducting future interventions.
* If a collaboration with an NGO is possible, we will be participating in the NGO's intervention process through which we will get a chance to learn the process of implementation of various intervention tools. This will allow us to better implement various strategy in Basapura.
* We will invite the experts like Nilajanardya to give lectures on the importance of the SDMC during the interventive meetings.
* Conducting capacity building programme to help the members to deal with budget and financial related issues of SDMC.
